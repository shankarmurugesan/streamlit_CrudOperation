Step 2: Install MySQL Connector

To connect your Streamlit app to a MySQL database, you need a MySQL connector. The mysql-connector-python package allows you to connect to MySQL databases from Python.

Command:

pip install mysql-connector-python


Explanation of Commands:

1) pip install streamlit:

This command installs the Streamlit library.
Streamlit is used for creating web applications with interactive elements directly from Python scripts.
It simplifies the process of creating web interfaces for data analysis and machine learning models.


2) pip install mysql-connector-python:

This command installs the MySQL Connector for Python.
It allows you to connect to and interact with a MySQL database using Python.
The connector handles the communication between your Python code and the MySQL database, enabling you to execute SQL queries, retrieve data, and perform database operations.
